= leaflet.pm cljs wrapped

Provides externs and deps.cljs for leaflet.pm.

Add to your deps.edn:

[source,clojure]
----
com.github.SevereOverfl0w/leaflet.pm {:git/url "https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w/cljs-leaflet.pm.git" :sha "8036c460e2ccbf673f99be9227a10983e15179a0" :tag "v0.25.0-0"}
----

== Usage

Add to your namespace:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.app
  (:require
    [leaflet :as L]
    [leaflet.pm]))

(let [map (L/map "map")]
  (.enableDraw (.-pm map) "Rectangle" #js {}))
----

== Externs

The externs are fairly incomplete and need more completion.
Due to leaflet.pm, auto-generation has shown itself to be difficult.
Currently I am pushing externs as they are required for myself.
PRs will be gladly merged with little review if they add externs.

== Updating leaflet.pm

Run `./fetch-latest.sh` from the root directory of the repo.
It will fetch & tag a new release.
